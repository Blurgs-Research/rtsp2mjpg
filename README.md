### RTSP to MJPEG stream conversion using FFmpeg and FFserver

Override the default `RTSP_URL` with your own stream as needed.


#### Output

Stream: `<IP>:8090/live.mjpg`  
Still: `<IP>:8090/still.jpg`


*The ffserver.conf values are set for Wyze Cam V2 output. If you need to customize it you can pull the source and build with your own values.*
